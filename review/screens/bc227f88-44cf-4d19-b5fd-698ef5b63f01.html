It is defined as a relationship imposed by law where someone has voluntarily agreed to act in the capacity of a &ldquo;caretaker&rdquo; of another&rsquo;s rights, assets, and/or well-being.<br /><br />Financial sustainability: The ability of a school to carry out its mission in a fiscally effective manner both in the present as well as in the long-term future.<br /><br />Form 990 (IRS): The Form 990 provides the public with financial information about a given organization, and is often the only source of such information. It is also used by government agencies to prevent organizations from abusing their tax-exempt status. In June 2007, the IRS released a new Form 990 that requires significant disclosures on corporate governance and boards of directors.<br /><br />In loco parentis: From the Latin, &ldquo;in place of the parents;&rdquo; acting with parental responsibility and/or authority<br /><br />Pedagogical Values: What the school believes and implements about teaching and learning.<br /><br />Planned giving: Planned giving is commonly used to describe contributions that involve commitments from a family through the use of wills, trusts or estates.
